# NVIDIA_data_science_with_RAPIDS
Fundamentals of accelerated data science with RAPIDS workshop by the Deep Learning Institute at NVIDIA.

The first two parts of this module are for excercising purposes. The third part is for testing purposes, which is why I do not upload the solutions. Feel free to try and solve them.
